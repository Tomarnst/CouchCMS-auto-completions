CouchCMS completions file for Sublime-Better-Completion

I created this file for my own use and not all CouchCMS Tags are in here (yet).

Anyhow for those using CouchCMS and work with Sublime Text, Install Sublime Better Completion Package and drop this file into your Sublime-Better-Completion-master/sublime-completions folder if you like.
